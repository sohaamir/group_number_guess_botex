                You will be playing a number guessing game for {{ NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds in a group of {{ PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }}.
            </p>
            
            <h6>How to Play:</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>In each round, you will guess a number <b>between 0 and 100.</b></li>
                <li>You will have <b>10 seconds</b> to make your guess.</li>
                <li>A <b>random</b> target number will be generated.</li>
                <li>After you submit your guess, you will need to wait for the 10 second limit to expire before starting the next round and making your next guess.</li>
                <li>Your score for each round is the <b>absolute difference</b> between your guess and the target number.</li>
                <li>If you don't answer within the time limit, a <b>value of 100</b> will be assigned as your guess.</li>
                <li>The player with the <b>lowest total score</b> (closest guesses) across all rounds will win.</li>
            </ul>
